# State-Guessing-Game
It is a fun learning quiz game which I build in python through turtle module and pandas library to make dataset and to form result of game. In this person has to guess all the states of India and if correct name will appear on Indian map and score will increase. At the end it also provides the list of states missed by player


DATASET
To make dataset first I got image of empty india state map then convert it into gif( turtle work with gif format) then I got the coordiantes of the state respective of images by a small code 


above code I took from stackoverflow After doing this I have this dataset, I added state name and then insert their coordinate seperated by ',' to make csv file
